🐾 Dog Kennel Management System

A simple Java-based mini-project that simulates a real-world dog kennel where each dog can perform actions, interact with others, and have its health tracked.
This project focuses on object-oriented programming fundamentals, including classes, objects, methods, reference variables, and object re-assignment.

🧩 Features:-

🐶 Create Dogs: Each dog has a name, age, and vaccination status.
🐕 Dog Actions: Dogs can bark, eat, walk, and sleep.
🤝 Dog Interaction: Dogs can meet and become friends.
💉 Vaccination Update: Track and update vaccination status.
🏠 Kennel Management: Replace or add new dogs in the kennel.
❤️ Health Monitoring: Run health checks on all dogs.

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated:-

- Class and Object creation
- Reference variables and memory behavior
- Encapsulation and method operations
- Progressive object modification
- Real-world simulation through methods
